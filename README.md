# About Me

Hi! I'm qDot (aka Kyle Machulis). I code all sorts of stuff, these days mostly in Rust.

You may know me from such open source projects as:

- [Buttplug Intimate Haptics](https://github.com/buttplugio)
- [blteplug Cross-Platform Bluetooth LE Library](https://github.com/deviceplug/btleplug)
- [libnifalcon Novint Falcon Drivers](https://github.com/libnifalcon)
- [Various parts of the Firefox Web Browser](https://github.com/mozilla)
- [OpenYou Health/QuantifiedSelf Projects](https://openyou.org)
- [OpenKinect Microsoft Kinect Drivers](https://github.com/openkinect)
- Who knows what else, I get up to a lot...

# Ways to Hire Me or Sponsor My Work

I'm available for consulting in Haptics, VR, Virtual Worlds, hardware/driver development, and other topics via my company, [Nonpolynomial](https://nonpolynomial.com).

If you like my work but are just interested in sponsoring instead of consulting, you can [sponsor me on github](https://github.com/sponsors/qdot)! There are tier levels with perks like stickers, credits in my youtube videos, and 1:1 video conferences!

If Patreon works better for you:

- [Patreon for my virtual world and DIY hardware (SFW) work](https://patreon.com/poor-life-choices),
- [Patreon for my Intimate Haptics (NSFW) work](https://patreon.com/qdot),

If you're just interested in a one-off donation, [I've got a Ko-Fi page just for that](https://ko-fi.com/qdot76367), which is a great way to donate and also get stickers or other perks without having a recurring donation.
